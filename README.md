# PremiumAds AdMob Adapter - SPM

A Swift Package Manager (SPM) wrapper for the PremiumAds AdMob Adapter framework, 
enabling easy integration into iOS projects using SPM.

## Overview

This package wraps the PremiumAds AdMob Adapter XCFramework from the official 
[mobile-ads-sdk repository](https://github.com/premium-ads/mobile-ads-sdk/tree/refs/heads/main/ios/admob-adapter), 
making it available for projects that use Swift Package Manager instead of CocoaPods.

## Why This Wrapper?

The official PremiumAds SDK only provides CocoaPods integration. This wrapper allows 
developers who prefer or require SPM to integrate the AdMob adapter seamlessly into 
their iOS projects.
